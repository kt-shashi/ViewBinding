# ViewBinding 

### Use:

<br>

> View binding makes it much easier and faster to call methods on the views in your UI.

<br>
Here we are creating an app (using Kotlin) that calculates tip based on how good the service was.
<br>
<br>

### Let's start by enabling view binding

<br>
In build.gradle(:app) add the code in -> android { ... }

```bash
android {
    buildFeatures {
        viewBinding = true
    }
}
```

Before the onCreate() method, we initialize our binding object

```bash
lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding
```

Now, we perform the following steps in onCreate() method:

- Call the inflate() method to create an instance of the binding class for the activity to use.
- Get reference to the root view
- Pass the root view to setContentView() instead of setContentView(R.id.activity_main)

```bash
lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

    binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
    setContentView(binding.root)
}
```

Now to get reference of any view, we can use the binding object:

```bash
binding.buttonResult.setOnClickListener { }
val cost: String = binding.editTextCost.text.toString()
```

> Note: The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to camel case and adding the word "Binding" to the end. Similarly, the reference for each view is generated by removing underscores and converting the view name to camel case. For example, activity_main.xml becomes ActivityMainBinding, and you can access @id/text_view as binding.textView.
